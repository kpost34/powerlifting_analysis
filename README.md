# **Powerlifting Analysis Project**
Explore powerlifting data through statistics and visualizations.

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to learn more about the sport of powerlifting through data exploration and visualization. The dataset is from the Open Powerlifting project (openpowerlifting.org) and consists of powerlifters that competed in raw, full-power events in the United States from 1/10/15 through 10/11/20. The data were cleaned and wrangled prior to visualization.
